There are 5 .py files
  1. Topic.py : is topic for manual controling will send data while controlling using type in command.
  2. Auto_topic.py : is topic for using client as 10 random command to control.
  3. Home_topic.py : is topic for type in a home command.
  4. Control.py : is server file to store all command and respond of each input in it.
  5. Automove.py : is client file to send command to server to do as client command.
  
The output of topic is still bug due to wrong node writting but I can't find the roots of the bug so it's still unfix.
